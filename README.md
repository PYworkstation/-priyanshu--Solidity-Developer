 Implementing a Token Airdrop Smart Contract

   Creating the Smart  Contract -
   
        In this contract:
              We import the ERC-20 interface from the OpenZeppelin library, a popular library for building secure and reliable smart contracts.
              The contract inherits from the `IERC20` interface, which ensures that it adheres to the ERC-20 standard.
              We define key attributes such as the token’s name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.
              The `balances` mapping keeps track of the token balances of each address, and the `allowances` mapping tracks approved spending allowances.
              The constructor initializes the balance of the contract creator with the total supply of tokens.
              The `transfer` function allows users to transfer tokens to other addresses, following ERC-20 rules.
 Implementing the ERC-20 Standards
 
               For ERC-20 tokens, it’s crucial to implement the required functions defined by the ERC-20 standard, such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `allowance`. These functions enable token 
               transfers, approval of spending, and management of allowances.
               Handling Transactions and Events 
               In Solidity, you can handle transactions using the `transfer` and `send` functions to send ether (ETH) and the `call` function for more complex interactions with external contracts. However, when 
               dealing with token transfers, you’ll primarily use the `transfer` function provided by your token contract.

Creating a React web page with connection to Metamask

       Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

                           Node.js and npm (or yarn) - Installation Guide
                           MetaMask browser extension - Install MetaMask


Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd react-webpage-with-metamask
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the development server and open the webpage in your default web browser.

Configure MetaMask:

If you haven't already, install the MetaMask browser extension and create an Ethereum account.
Ensure MetaMask is connected to the appropriate Ethereum network (e.g., Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby).
Interact with the webpage:


Once connected, you should be able to interact with Ethereum functionality provided by the webpage.
